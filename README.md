# BritishAirways_DataScienceProject Task 1
(Task 2 to follow in the next repository)
# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Task

## Task Overview
The goal of this project is to scrape review data from the Skytrax website, specifically focusing on reviews about the airline. Once the data is collected, you are required to perform data cleaning and analysis to uncover insights. Finally, the findings should be presented in a concise and visually appealing PowerPoint slide for the upcoming board meeting.

## Instructions

### 1. Data Collection (Web Scraping)
- Use the provided "Jupyter Notebook" in the Resources section to run Python code for scraping review data from Skytrax.
- Focus on reviews about the airline itself.
- Collect as much relevant data as possible to enhance the analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Analysis
- Prepare the collected dataset by addressing any messiness and extracting relevant information.
- Utilize Python for data cleaning, and consider techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to gain insights.
- Ensure you have a "data" folder created, and map your file path accordingly.

### 3. Presentation of Insights
- Summarize your findings on a single PowerPoint slide using the provided "PowerPoint Template."
- Create visualizations and metrics to convey key points from your analysis.
- Provide clear and concise explanations for each insight.
- Ensure the slide is structured in a way that facilitates quick understanding.
